# DPRC

DPRC is a rapid method for genetic evaluation and genomic prediction by incorporating biological information of SNP markers. The core algorithm is Dirichlet Process regression model, but considering the effect of SNP classes by allocating SNP to the different classes. We define two different models, named DPRC-F and DPRC-R, according to different strategies for allocating SNP to the four classes. The DPRC-F divide the WGS variants into four classes based on the variantâ€™s biological function. All SNPs were annotated to specific genome regions based on the relevant reference genome and then were divided into four classes. In this DPRC-F model, each variant is fixed to a certain class. To further relax the class burden of DPRC-F, DPRC-R method is further proposed to randomly allocate each variant to different classes during the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.
